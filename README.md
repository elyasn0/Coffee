    Coffee the game

    This is a game in which you need to protect your mug from various objects that meet on the way. In the game was implemented a store for mugs and gliders, as well as 5 levels. Many things in the game are not implemented such as advertising, in-game store, leaderboard, and the game itself was never released. I made it for practice during my student days. The visuals, code and level design I did by myself.

    The store is full of references to other iconic games and movies.

    level with sushi tests the player's reaction. The objects are quite small and move chaotically.

    Fast food is heavy, so it takes effort to push a burger off the table.

    At the beginning of the level with grapes, the player is given a tray to cover the cup with. If the player uses it correctly, the level is easy to complete
